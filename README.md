# Effects of Maintenance Treatment Duration on Relapse in ANCA-Associated Vasculitis

## Project Overview
This repository contains the dissertation submitted for the Master of Science in Computer Science (Data Science) at Trinity College, Dublin. The research focuses on analyzing how varying durations of maintenance treatment affect relapse rates in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), utilizing advanced causal inference techniques on real-world data from the PARADISE project.

## Methodology
The study applies causal inference methods, including Counterfactual Analysis, Virtual Twins, and Synthetic Counterfactual Forests, to estimate Individual Treatment Effects (ITE) and assess the impact of treatment duration on relapse rates. These methods help in understanding the treatment efficacy across different patient subgroups and timeframes (16, 20, and 24 months).

## Key Findings
- *Treatment Duration*: Longer maintenance treatments are associated with reduced relapse rates, highlighting the importance of duration in treatment planning.
- *Patient Variability*: There is significant variability in patient responses, suggesting a need for personalized treatment strategies.
- *Data-Driven Insights*: The application of data science techniques offers new insights into the optimal management of AAV, potentially improving patient outcomes through tailored treatment plans.
